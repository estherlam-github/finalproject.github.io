      <h4>Timeline:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>By 13</strong> - She was attending the high school on the campus of historically black West Virginia State College.</li>
        <li><strong>At 18</strong> - She enrolled in the college itself, where she made quick work of the school’s math curriculum and found a mentor in math professor W. W. Schieffelin Claytor, the third African American to earn a PhD in mathematics.</li>
        <li><strong>1937</strong> - She graduated with highest honors and took a job teaching at a black public school in Virginia.</li>
        <li><strong>1939</strong> - West Virginia State’s president, Dr. John W. Davis, selected her and two men to be the first black students offered spots at the state’s flagship school, West Virginia University.</li>
        <li><strong>1953</strong> - Katherine and her husband decided to move the family to Newport News, Virginia. Katherine began work at National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics’ (NACA’s) Langley laboratory.</li>
        <li><strong>1956</strong> - Her husband died of cancer in December.</li>
        <li><strong>1957</strong> - She provided some of the math for the 1958 document Notes on Space Technology, a compendium of a series of 1958 lectures given by engineers in the Flight Research Division and the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division (PARD).</li>
        <li><strong>1960</strong> - She and engineer Ted Skopinski coauthored Determination of Azimuth Angle at Burnout for Placing a Satellite Over a Selected Earth Position, a report laying out the equations describing an orbital spaceflight in which the landing position of the spacecraft is specified. It was the first time a woman in the Flight Research Division had received credit as an author of a research report.</li>
        <li><strong>1962</strong> - As NASA prepared for the orbital mission of John Glenn, Johnson was called upon to do the work that she would become most known for. Glenn’s flight was a success, and marked a turning point in the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union in space.</li>
        <li><strong>1986</strong> - She retired after 33 years at Langley. </li>
        <li><strong>2015</strong> - At age 97, Johnson added another extraordinary achievement to her long list: President Barack Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America’s highest civilian honor.</li>
        <li><strong>2020</strong> - She died on February 24.</li>
